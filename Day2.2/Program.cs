 * The Elf finishes helping with the tent and sneaks back over to you.
 * "Anyway, the second column says how the round needs to end:
 *  X means you need to lose,
 *  Y means you need to end the round in a draw,
 *  and Z means you need to win. Good luck!"
 *
 * The total score is still calculated in the same way,
 * but now you need to figure out what shape to choose so the round ends as indicated.
 *
 * Following the Elf's instructions for the second column, what would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?
